# git-watcher

super lightweight CI tool

# Introduction

I have a project (https://github.com/isaac-j-miller/mirror-v2) which I deploy to a raspberry pi in my home. I don't want to SSH into the raspberry pi and update or restart the project every time I update the application, and I don't want to stand up a whole CI server on the thing because it's a raspberry pi zero and it doesn't have a lot of resources. So I wrote this simple miniature CI tool to listen for github webhooks and/or poll GitHub's API to check for new commits on a specified branch, if it isn't possible or desirable to set up NGINX, port forwarding, a static IP, etc.
